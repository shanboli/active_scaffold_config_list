Added routes, works with AS rails-2.3 branch and RoR 2.3.8
Added an icon at label 

---------------------
This works with Rails 2.3 and the rails-2.3 branch of ActiveScaffold.
Clone or view the source at: http://github.com/bonefish/active_scaffold_config_list

Usage:
Enabled by default. To disable add the following to your controller:
active_scaffold :model do |config|
  config.config_list.enabled = false
end

Enhancements:
Two new options have been added: "Reset to Default" and "Show All Columns"

You have the option of defining a default set of columns for the controller.
e.g
config.config_list.default_columns = [:name, :project, :amount]
If this is not defined then active_scaffold_config.list.columns is used.

This is useful when you want the option to look at a potentially large number of columns but be able to
easily reset back to something that fits on the screen without horizontal scrolling.

Overview

A plugin for Active Scaffold that provides the ability to choose the column to show in the scaffold list at run-time
Features

The configuration data will be saved on the session.
Installation

To install the plugin:

For active_scaffold 1.1.1

./script/plugin install http://activescaffoldconfiglist.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/active_scaffold_config_list

For active_scaffold 1.0

./script/plugin install http://activescaffoldconfiglist.googlecode.com/svn/tags/for_as_1.0/active_scaffold_config_list

Use

This plugin automatically adds an action labeled 'List columns...' to every scaffold. Now you can show/hide the columns in the list.

To define which are the default visible columns add this line to the active scaffold config section of your controller:

config.config_list.default_columns = [:name, :description, ...]

To exclude config list for a controller:

config.config_list.enabled = false

Suggestion

Useful if used with acts_as_proxy plugin

http://code.google.com/p/actsasproxy/

Example: Model:

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_one :address
  proxies :address, :city, :state, :zip
end

Scaffold:

config.list.columns = [:first_name,  :last_name, :address_city, :adress_state, :address_zip, ...]
...
config.config_list.default_columns = [:first_name, last_name]
}}

So you can have by default a minimal list and add columns at run-time
